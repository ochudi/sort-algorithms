# Sorting and Searching Algorithms

This repository contains various implementations of sorting and searching algorithms in different programming languages. The purpose of this repository is to provide examples and comparisons of varying algorithm implementations across different versions.

## Algorithms Included
- Radix Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Binary Search

## Programming Languages
- Ruby
- Pascal
- Python
- C++
- Java

## Usage
Each programming language directory contains separate files for each algorithm implementation. To use a specific algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Choose the desired programming language directory.
2. Locate the file corresponding to the algorithm of interest.
3. Open the file in your preferred editor or IDE.
4. Copy and incorporate the code into your own project or experimentation.

Please note that each algorithm implementation may have specific requirements and input formats. Make sure to read the code comments and documentation within each file for more details.
